                                    <p>Researchers at Keele University in England have discovered that most HR departments prefer a CV that is not longer than two sides of A4.

                                    Given that HRs have tonnes of Resume to scan through its highly advisable to keep your Resume shorter than two pages or one page back to back </p>

                                    <p>The Answer is yes you most definitely should, especially if you're a student, hobbies fall under extacurricular activities. Putting extracurricular activities on your resume gives hiring managers a glimpse into your interests outside of your grades and test scores.

                                    <p>If you’ve only just graduated or are looking for your first job, you may feel like you don’t have any work experience to list on your resume. The key to this is showing passion and elaborating on the skills that you have developed throughout education and other non-professional experiences. By writing an enthusiastic personal summary, you can demonstrate that you are driven and focused on building a career within a certain area
                                    <br></br>
                                    <br></br>

                                    You should then provide a list of all of your qualifications, hobbies and past projects that have allowed you to develop transferrable skills that make you equipped for the job. Even if you have no formal work experience, volunteer work and undertaking projects at school/uni allow you to develop skills in areas such as customer service, time management and team work that will benefit you professionally.</p>

                                    <p>The likelihood of an employment gap damaging your chances of landing a new job really depends on how long ago it was and how long it was for. If the period of time was years ago and you’ve been back in work for some time, it really isn’t anything to worry about and will probably go unnoticed.

                                    On the other hand, if your break in employment has happened more recently, which has spanned over several months or even years, then you may want to think about how you can explain this in a way that won’t hinder your job hunt.</p>
